This above SQL code identifies the top 10 highest-paying Data Analyst positions with available salary information,
regardless of location. It first creates a temporary table top_paying_jobs containing the job ID, job title,
average yearly salary, and company name for these top-paying positions.
Then, it retrieves the skills required for each of these positions by joining with the skills_job_dim and skills_dim tables.
The final output includes all the details from the top_paying_jobs table along with the associated skills,
ordered by the average yearly salary in descending order.
